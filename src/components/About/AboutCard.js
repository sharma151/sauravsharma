            Hi, I am <span className="purple">Saurav sharma </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Darbhanga, India.</span>
            <br />I am currently working as a Frontend Developer at Young
            Innovation Pvt. Ltd., Nepal, where I focus on building secure,
            user-friendly, and scalable web applications. With a background in
            Computer Science Engineering and a specialization in cybersecurity,
            I am passionate about applying my coding skills to solve real-world
            problems and strengthen digital security.
            <br />
            <br />
            My journey has included hands-on experiences across cybersecurity,
            web development, software development, and testing. Iâ€™ve interned
            with organizations like the All India IT Association, MP Police
            Cyber Cell, Persistent Systems, and Oasis Infobyte, each of which
            enriched my technical expertise and problem-solving capabilities
            through meaningful project work.
            <br />
            <br /> I have also pursued professional development through
            certifications like the IBM Cybersecurity Professional Certification
            and the Meta Frontend Development course. These have equipped me
            with a strong foundation in both cybersecurity and frontend
            technologies, enabling me to deliver secure and intuitive digital
            experiences. I am enthusiastic about continuous learning and am
            eager to contribute to innovative projects that make a positive
            impact on the digital world. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
